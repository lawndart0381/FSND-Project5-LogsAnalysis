# README - Udacity Project: Logs Analysis Project



The **Logs Analysis Project** is the third of several projects within the **Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree** offered by **_Udacity_**.  This project is to simulate an **internal reporting tool** that will query information from the **news** database to answer three questions:
* What are the most popular three articles of all time?
* Who are the most popular authors of all time?
* On which days did more than 1% of the requests lead to errors?

This README assumes that you have already setup the **virtual machine** with **_VirtualBox_** and **_Vagrant_**, and you have configured the **VM** with the files provided by **_Udacity_**.
